## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Highlight manager with add, remove, and clear commands.
- Support for match case, whole word, and regex searches per highlight rule.
- Custom color picker for each highlight plus automatic updates as the document changes.
- Sidebar webview panel that lists highlight rules, allows inline edits, navigation buttons, inline option toggles, and quick removal/addition actions.
- Always-visible add form inside the panel (Enter to submit) with iconized Match Case / Whole Word / Regex toggles, a color picker, CSS input, and automatic text contrast for previews.
- Form option toggles persist between additions, highlight colors auto-rotate through unused hues, and the navigation ▲ button correctly jumps to the previous match.
